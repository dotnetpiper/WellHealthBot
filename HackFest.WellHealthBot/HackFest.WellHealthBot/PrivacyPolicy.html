<p><strong>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION:

</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Experience: </strong>Delivering a more relevant and curated experience to members, including by recommending services or content we think members will enjoy.

</p>
<p><strong>Business Purposes and Research:</strong> Analyzing and improving the services we offer (including on or through the Digital Properties), better understanding our business and members, evaluating products and services that may be of interest to you, and carrying out internal purposes and research and otherwise operating our business.  This may include aggregating information regarding you across our entire user base or part of our user base.

<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or in other situations where we have otherwise provided clear prior notice to you, WellHealth does not sell, rent or otherwise share your name, e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties.  We may, however, share information for the following reasons and with the following persons:
</p>
<p><strong>Agents and Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include creating and maintaining our Digital Properties, sending postal mail and e-mail, managing and updating customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.

</p>
<p><strong>Social Media and Third Party Apps: </strong>We may share information with social networks when you interact with the Digital Properties (e.g., a clicking a Facebook &ldquo;like&rdquo; button) or connect your social media accounts to the Digital Properties.  If you elect to connect Third Party Apps to the Digital Properties, your information may also be shared with these third parties.  Please see below for more information on this, as we do not control these third parties or their privacy practices.
</p>
<p><strong>Compliance and Protection: </strong>We reserve the right to disclose any personal information we have concerning you if we determine doing so is necessary or desirable to: comply with our obligations under the law or in connection with any legal process or investigative or governmental requests; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of WellHealth, its affiliates, our users, members or employees, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, as well as providing information to law enforcement and governmental authorities.
</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Transactions:</strong> In the event of a reorganization, merger or sale of WellHealth or any of its affiliates, we may transfer any and all personal information we have collected to the relevant third party.

</p>
<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES:
</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons to enhance your experience on our Digital Properties. For example, a cookie enables us to remember the region or specific club page you have visited so the next time you return to our site you do not have to select that club or region again.
</p>
<p>You can adjust how your Internet browser (like Chrome or Safari) responds to cookies (e.g., to warn you every time a cookie is sent, or to turn off all cookies). See your browser's Help menu for these instructions. By disabling your cookies, please understand you will not have access to some of the features that enhance your user experience on the Digital Properties.
</p>
<p>WellHealth does not currently allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when that individual uses the Digital Properties and therefore does not respond to web browser &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals.
</p>
<p><strong>USE BY ADULTS AND TEENAGERS:</strong></p>
<p>WellHealth offers membership to individuals who are at least 18 years of age. However, teenagers that are at least 16 years of age may also join with the written consent of a parent.  Similarly, the Digital Properties are intended for use by adults, and you must be at least 18 years of age or, for teenagers ages 16 to 18, have parental consent, to provide personally identifying information to us. The Digital Properties are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTY SITES AND APPS:</strong></p>
<p>While the Digital Properties may contain links to other sites, products or services, please note that when you click on one of these links, you are 'clicking' away from the Digital Properties and accessing a third party&rsquo;s website, app or other digital property.  In addition, certain features of the Digital Properties may enable you to connect the Digital Properties to, or otherwise share your information with, Third Party Apps.
</p>
<p>Please understand that these third parties may collect information about you which will be used under their privacy policies.  We encourage you to read the privacy polices of these third parties, as their practices may differ from ours. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR THE COLLECTION OR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION FROM ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.
